# R2-D2 - A Robotics Journey
The repository contains the files to build a smaller-scale replica of the R2-D2 droid from the Star Wars universe. The robot can move around and rotate its head, just like in the movies. It is controlled with a simple PS controller. This robotics project was created entirely by me for Hack Club's Highway to Undercity event.

## The Start of the Journey
As a **HUGE** Star Wars fan and a robotics enthusiast, I have always thought it would be so cool to have my very own droid, just like the characters from the movies. Through my two years of experience in a FIRST Robotics Competition team (shoutout team 9477), I was able to learn all the skills I would need to build my own droid. When I was introduced to the Hack Club's Highway to Undercity event, which provides high school students with grants to build their dream projects, I knew that this would be the perfect opportunity for me to practice my robotics skills by building a droid. I decided to attempt to build R2-D2, the most iconic droid of the Star Wars Universe.

## About R2-D2
In the movies, R2 has a wide range of abilities such as movement, flight, tasers, a holographic projector, etc. For this project, I decided to focus on two key points of functionality for the droid: movement and head rotation. The robot has three "feet" -- one on the left, one on the right, and one in the center -- each containing a Pololu 12V Motor attached to a wheel. A PS3 controller is used to control the motors and move the droid. A stepper motor is used to control the rotation of R2-D2's head. An ESP32 is used in order to control all of the motor drivers.
