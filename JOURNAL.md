**Total Time Spent:** 47 hours

**NOTE - As I was designing the robot, I was not very consistent with journaling. Thus, many of these entries are being written retroactively after the design has already been completed. Luckily, Onshape has a very good built-in version control system, meaning it is very easy for me to see what I did each day and how long I spent working.**

### JOURNAL DAY ONE - MAY 25, 2025
Today I began designing the R2D2's dome-shaped head on OnShape. The goal is for this part to be able to rotate freely. I started off by creating a Notion workspace to organize a few reference images that I would be using. My original plan was to make a life-sized R2D2, but I quickly realized that building a 3' 7" robot as my first individual hardware project would be too large of a scope. I ended up creating my own dimensions that may not be perfectly accurate to the movies, but still very closely resemble R2. The idea with the head is to separately 3D print the main dome and the blue fills. The fills can then be hot-glued into inserts on the dome. This took me a fairly long time as I have limited Onshape experience. **NOTE - As this journal entry is being written retroactively I can note that the way I designed the head initially when I started was not the best way to do it. Upon talking with a friend with more Onshape experience than me, I redesigned the head in a much cleaner and better way.**

**Time Spent:** 7 hours (over two sessions)
