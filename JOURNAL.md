JORNAL DAY ONE - MAY 25, 2025
Today I began designing the R2D2's done-shaped head on OnShape. The goal is for this part to be able to rotate freely. I think it could be interesting to add a camera inside the eye, and have the robot navigate autonomously. although that may be increasing the scope of the project a little too much. I started by creating a Notion workspace to organize a few reference images that I would be using. My original plan was to make a life-sized R2D2, but I quickly realized that building a 3' 7" robot as my first individual hardware project was a bit much. I ended up creating my own dimensions that may not be perfectly accurate to the movies, but they still at least resemble R2.
